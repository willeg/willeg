### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Many years ago I started out as a programmer on DEC PDP-11 RSTS/E systems.
### Later I switched to MS DOS and and then stayed within the Microsoft world until retirement age: 16-bit assembler, C compiler, COM, Visual Basic, C#, .Net through all the versions of a plethora of development tools.   
### I have now started learning Salesforce Apex and SOQL programming.
